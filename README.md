# STEVE

A library for data production and analysis regarding particle tracking for the positron detector at MUSE in JPARC.

This repository currently contains only the code that produces the tracks (contained inside the `track-simulation` folder) and that which converts the simulated tracks into data the detector would provide.

Usage instructions and further documentation will soon follow. For getting started however, I would recommend you follow the Jupyter Notebook located at `detector-simulation/Analysing Tracks/Analysing The Data.ipynb`, where you can also see the tracks that were produced by the overall program.
